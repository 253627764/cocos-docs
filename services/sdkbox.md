# SDKBOX - The Cure for SDK Fatigue

SDKBOX makes it EASY and FREE for Cocos2d-x developers to integrate popular 3rd party SDKs into their games. All SDKBOX plugins are TESTED and CERTIFIED. No matter which version of cocos2d-x that you are using, C++ or Javascript or Lua, SDKBOX will reduce your integration time from days or weeks down to minutes!

## Use SDKBOX from Cocos
#### Prerequisite
First, select needed SDKs in Cocos using "create a project" or "edit a project". All selected SDKs will be automatically installed in your project. 

#### Next Step
* You need to update the SDKs' configuration in `sdkbox_config.json`. And then you can start to call SDKs' APIs in your game.  
* Please checkout plugins' documentation for [detail instructions for each plugin](http://docs.sdkbox.com/en/).


## Use SDKBOX Installer
SDKBOX Installer is an optional command line tool for any version of cocos2d-x projects, including both v2.x and v3.x. It lets you integrate SDK plugins by a single line of command. ([Learn more](http://docs.sdkbox.com/en/installer/))


## Install SDKBOX manually
If you prefer to see exactly which libaries and assets are needed for a integration, you can download the plugn bundle file. A bundle packages everything including SDK libs, instrucations, and sample codes. You can download the bundle files from [the SDKBOX Plugins page](http://sdkbox.com).
