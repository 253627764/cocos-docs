# Animation system
This chapter will introduce the animation system of Cocos Creator. Apart from standard
movement, rotation, zooming in/out of animation and sequence frame animation, this
set of animation systems also supports the drive of arbitrary component properties
and user-defined properties. Adding a time curve that can be edited arbitrarily and
the innovative function of editing the movement path, it can help content creators
create various complicated and exquisite dynamic effects without writing a single
line of code.
