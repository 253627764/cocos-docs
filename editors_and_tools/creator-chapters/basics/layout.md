# Editor layout

Editor layout refers to the position, size and stack information of panels in Cocos Creator.

Select the `layout` menu from the main menu and you can choose the most suitable editor panel layout from the pre-set ones for your current project. You can adjust the position and size of each panel on the basis of the pre-set layout. The alteration to the layout will be auto-saved to the `local/layout.windows.json` file in the project folder.

## Adjust panel size

Position the mouse on the border line of two panels and drag when the cursor changes shape to change the size of the two adjacent panels.

Some panels have the minimum size setting, so the panel size won't be reduced if it reaches its size limitation.

## Move panels

Click the tab bar on the panel and drag to move the whole panel to any position in the editor window. The red box in the picture below shows the tab bar area that can be dragged and the arrow shows the drag direction:

The blue translucent box will show the position where the panel will be placed once the mouse is released when moving the panel.

## Stack panels

Other than moving the panel position, you can also move the mouse to the tab bar area of another panel when dragging the tab bar:

Release the mouse when the tab bar appears orange, so the two panels can be stacked together. Only one panel can be displayed at a time:

![stack after](layout/stack_after.png)

Panels in a stack can be very practical when the desk resolution is not enough or the panel layout usage rate is low. Panels in a stack can be dragged out at any time to recover the display of the panel that is placed at the top.
