# Asset workflow

## Adding an asset

There are three ways to add assets into a project:

* Using the **create** button to add assets
* In the operating system file manager, copy the asset file to the project assets folder and then reopen or activate the Cocos Creator window to finish importing the asset.
* Drag asset files from the operating system file manager (such as Explorer in Windows or Finder in Mac OS) to the **assets** panel to import the asset.

### Importing an asset from outside
You can drag files from another window in the operating system to the **assets** panel in Cocos Creator window in order to import assets from the outside. This operation will auto copy the asset files to the project asset files and finish the importing operation.

## Importing and synchronizing assets
The assets in **assets** and the project asset files seen in the file manager are synchronised. Moving, renaming and deleting assets in **assets** will do the same alterations to the asset files in the user's file system. Likewise, reopening or activating the Cocos Creator program after adding or deleting assets in the file system (such as Explorer in Windows or Finder in Mac OS)  will update the assets in **assets**.

## Common asset workflow
Next, we will introduce Cocos Creator's main asset types and the related workflows:

- [Scene asset](scene-managing.md)
- [Image asset](sprite.md)
- [Atlas](atlas.md)
- [Font asset](font.md)
- [Particle asset](particle.md)
- [Audio asset](audio-asset.md)
